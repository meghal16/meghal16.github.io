			<p>Bitcoin broke the resistance of $6600 on the daily chart, after having formed a valley pattern. Interesting to see if continues its rally from the current price of $7057. A correction to $6095 looks likely as the RSI is clocked in at 89, which represents an overbought market condition.

				<p>Ethereum enjoyed a good run after there were rumour that CFTC was going to green signal Ethereum futures. What would this mean? This would mean instutional investors can take positions in the futures and henceforth, bringing more adaptability to light. On Technical analysis, the ETH/USD pair formed a rising wedge, and it seems that it almost broke it. However, if it fails to sustain above the wedge it may fall to $146 which is the support where 38.2% fibonnaci level which also happens to be the 200-day MA level.</p>
